# AgriQultura (Blockchain Capstone Project)

## What is AgriQultura?

AgriQultura is a joint-effort project of Questronix developers to try and solve trust and other problems such as inequality, under pricing, and alleged exploitation of low income farmers in the agricultural supply chain by the use of blockchain technology. This serves as their Capstone project for Blockchain Development Program taken at Unionbank's Apptitude website (https://ubpxcellerator.apptitude.xyz/course/blockchain-development-program-576/).

## How's this done?

The developers created an mobile app called AgriQultura that allows producers (local farmers) post and upload their goods and produce. It also allows wholesalers (people who buys in bulk, usually resellers/store owners in a small community market) to register to the app, creating a virtual agricultural marketplace.

Every Transactions and User Reviews in AgriQultura is stored in the blockchain using a Smart Contract. Data is being stored publicly, so the transaction records can not easily be tampered. 

Since the transaction data is publicly available and reliable, prices of goods from producers can not be bought in an underpriced manner by the wholesalers. This also gives the producers and the public the opportunity to see what their goods are actually work in a specific area in a specific time, which the developers hope in turn encourages other land owners to also grow goods and increase the overall agricultural produce of the area.

User reviews are also available publicly through blockchain, which gives the producers and wholesalers the opportunity to review one another. This encourages competitive behavior among the producers (increase quality of goods, upscale production, etc.) and wholesalers (buy fairly, create healthy relations with producers, etc.).
